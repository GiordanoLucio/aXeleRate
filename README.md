This fork of axeleRate has been used to train several neural network based on tiny yolo for the task of person detection. Several new feature extractor are being implemented to try optimizing the process by increasing the performances in terms of speed, without losing quality of the detections. For the moment, three different feature extractor have been added. Two of those three feature extractor networks are based on tiny yolo. We are trying to prune the standard tiny yolo to see if we can get good results.
